The time complexity of the Levdist method is O(m x n) where m is the length of the first string (s1) and n is the length of the second string (s2). The time complexity of the runTest method is O(N x m x n + S log S). The N is from iterating through all of the words, it calls the levDist method which is 0(m x n), and S log s is the time complexity of the sorting method provided by the LLM. The time complexity of the Main function is O(D + I x (N x m x n + S log S)). The O(D) is the dictionary being loaded, O(I) is the number of user inputs and every time a user input is done runTest is run so that has to be multiplied by the time complexity of runTest.
