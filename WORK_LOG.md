| April 5  |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                          I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| March 5  | 10:45 - 12:00 |                                                                                              We went over the premise and requirements of the problem sets. I also thought about possible solution. |
| March 7  | 8:45 - 10:00  |                                                        I continued to think about possible strategies with an approach storing edit distances in a 2d array seeming to be the most likely solution. |
| March 11 |  1:45 - 3:00  | We went over the levenshtein distance formula which will be used to solve the problem. I started a method to calculate levenshtein distance of two strings and added a few of the more basic cases. |
| March 13 | 12:35 - 1:50  |                                                                                                                I worked on my method to calculate levenshtein distance but have not tested it yet.  |
