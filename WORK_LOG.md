I also thought about possible solution. |

I started a method to calculate levenshtein distance of two strings and added a few of the more basic cases. |

| March 17 | 10:45 - 12:00 |                                                                                                                                                                        I started the Autocorrect and runtest methods to test my levenshtein distance method. I found a index out of bound error when testing due to forgetting to subtract 1 when doing the charat comparisons. Then I had an error where it was just return the incorrect amount of words. The problems were that the +1s were not in math.min parenthesis and that I forgot to initialize the first row and column. Now it is working properly. |
| March 19 | 8:45 - 10:00  | I added my trie from spellcheck as a possible speedup. I also added code to insert all of the words into the trie. I am still thinking about how I could use or modify my trie to improve the efficiency of the code. I am struggling to figure out what I should use it for. The only thing I've thought of so far with the current trie code I have is to more efficiently check if the typed word is a word in the given dictionary but I have not thought of how to use it to solve any other part of the problem more efficient, so I may end up not using it. I also continued to work on my runTest class. |

It currently passes all test cases but I am still working on speedups. |
